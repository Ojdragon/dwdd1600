            <h1> What is Kiwi Doodles?</h1>
            <p> Kiwi Doodles is a sight focused on selling <em>high quality</em> digital art! I suppose i should introduce myself, my name is Olivia and I am both the artist and the creator
            of this website. I believe that everyone needs color in their lives and through my unique works of art I intend on giving color to everyone. My pieces are designed to be eye
            catching and exciting, perfect for any home in desperate need of an upgrade, and if nothing I have available catches your fancy, please send me a request or a 
            comission and let me know what I can make for you!</p>

            <h1> How do I submit commisions? </h1>
            <p> To ask for comissions: please submit your request along with any referance images using the email address below. Please do not send me anything vulgar or excessively gory.
            I like to keep my art clean. Thank you! Use this same email for questions and concerns and I will do my best to get back to you in a timely manner. </p>

             <h1> Copyright </h1>
             <p> When searching for references, please do not send me anything that is owned by another artist, unless of course you are the artist and you want me to redraw your work.
             I do not ever want to take place in plagerism that could get me and you in trouble. You can usually see whether or not an image is copyrighted at the bottom of the image.
             Or by clicking on it! I will also check any images you send for copyright concerns. </p>
