        <h1>How'd I get here?</h1>
        <p>This website is but a small piece of a huge journey! A journey that began when I was very young! My name is Olivia and I'm from Provo, Utah
            A smallish town surrounded by mountains. I have always loved to draw and create. I've explored every medium from charcoal to water color, however
            nothing really stuck, I was never truly able to draw it how I saw it in my mind, that is until I discovered digital art! I found my true 
            potential as an artist in 2021 when I was gifted an art tablet. Given to me by my amazing mom Shannon. I took to it immediately and started
            to create more in depth and exciting artwork then ever before. Now I am a thriving artist and I was inspired to create this sight so that I can show
             my artowrk to the world! </p>
        <h1>This website</h1>
            <p> After growing my portfolio and realizing I wanted to sell I thought: well I need a way to sell now don't I? I just so happened to be taking a Web development
                class, where I was assigned the task of creating a website. Well I thought, I might as well just make it here for my assignment!
            </p>

                <p>This video is a short clip of another artist sketching a sea turtle, but it gives you a pretty good
                    idea of what my usual process looks like! This is also a great tutorial for beginners.</p>
